# Code Challenge

In this project a responsive web application for a banking app was created following the <a href="./public/instructions/Code Challenge for UI Devs - Login.pdf">requirements</a> and the designs provided for <a href="./public/instructions/designs desktop views.pdf">desktop</a>, <a href="./public/instructions/designs mobile views.pdf">mobile view</a> and their <a href="./public/instructions/designs components.pdf">components</a>. It consists of a first view simulating a Login form, another view for password recovery, and two basic views implemented for the Home and for the confirmation of data recovery.


## Technical Resources

- The `create-react-app` functionality was used to create the basic project
- `react-router-dom` was used for page navigation
- Functional components were created with `react`
- Styles were implemented using `styled-components` and `css`
- Icons were obtained from `material-ui`
- Typography was obtained from `fonts.google`
- "Controlled forms" in their states in `react`
- Media queries were used for responsiveness
- Responsiveness was implemented for small screen devices with a max-width of 768px 
- Accessibility criteria applied. Tested with Voice Over screen reader and AxeDev tools, a Chrome extension
